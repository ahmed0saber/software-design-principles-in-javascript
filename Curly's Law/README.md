# Curly's Law - Do One Thing

Curly's Law is about choosing a single, clearly defined goal for any particular bit of code: Do One Thing.

Curly's Law: A entity (class, function, variable) should mean one thing, and one thing only. It should not mean one thing in one circumstance and carry a different value from a different domain some other time. It should not mean two things at once. It should mean One Thing and should mean it all of the time.
