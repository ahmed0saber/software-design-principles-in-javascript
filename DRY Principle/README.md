# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Duplication of code can make code very difficult to maintain. Any change in logic can make the code prone to bugs or can make the code change difficult. This can be fixed by doing code reuse (DRY Principle).

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

The way to achieve DRY is by creating functions and classes to make sure that any logic should be written in only one place.
