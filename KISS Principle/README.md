# Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

Simple code has the following benefits:

- less time to write
- less chances of bugs
- easier to understand, debug and modify

Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
